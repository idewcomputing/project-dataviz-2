# 1-2 Understand Technical Tools

There are numerous ways to collect, process, and visualize data. Three popular tools are introduced here.

* **Spreadsheets** Spreadsheets are the Swiss Army Knives of data, providing a quick entry point to processing and visualizing data.
* **Python Notebooks** Python notebooks are increasingly popular choice for data scientists with many code libraries to making coding with data very efficient and powerful.
* **Web Apps** Web apps provide a universal way to share data visualizations through the browser and can be dynamically updated with live data.

These tools can be used in isolation or combined in a workflow. In order to better understand what is technically feasible for you project, complete the exercises for one or all three of the options.
