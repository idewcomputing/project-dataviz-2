# 2-3 Prototype

Prototyping will co-evolve with your teams data collection plan.

### Instructions

Create at least three prototypes for your team's dashboard. Each prototype can be mixed-media, like the example below, where you use a sketch embedded in a Google document to represent what your dashboard may look like.

Each prototype should contain the same elements your final dashboard will have.

1. **A title.**
2. **The dashboard visuals.** This can be a neatly done sketch or charts created by a digital tool like a spreadsheet.
3. **A link \(fake at the moment\) to how you will share your data.** Don't worry about including any current data you have.
4. **A paragraph or two** that clearly describes the methods your team used, the value the visualization has to stakeholders, and any conclusions your team can claim from the data analysis. For your prototypes this will simply be a draft description.
5. **A listing of team members and your school.**
6. **Date**.

_**Style the page as you like, but don't worry too much about style and color. Focus on clarity and content.**_

#### Get Feedback

Get feedback from classmates outside of your team to check for any obvious problems, then each team member should get feedback from at least 2 people outside of class on your prototypes. Be prepared to outline and discuss the feedback received.
