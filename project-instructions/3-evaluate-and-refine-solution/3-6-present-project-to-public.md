# 3-6 Present Project to Public

![](../../.gitbook/assets/phase4.png)

Now is the time to refine all the details, review the process your team used to develop your visualization, and plan how you will tell your story to others.

Based on the experience of your latest in-class presentation, plan and practice your team's approach to the public presentation. Be prepared to do the following.

* Explain the topic and value of your team's dashboard. 
* Summarize major points in your team's process with the project. 
* Sharing the value of each activity leading up to the solution. \(Be honest about what went well or didn't.\) 
* Explain individual contributions and roles in the project, and a reflection of what you learned about collaborating on a team. 
* Share your individual perspective on potential careers and how they relate to computing, and include specific pathways you are investigating, like other courses, certification, college, or internships.

## Enjoy and celebrate the work you have done!
